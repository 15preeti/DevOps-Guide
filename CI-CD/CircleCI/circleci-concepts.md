# What Is Continuous Integration (CI)? 
Continuous integration (CI) is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy. Developers continually commit code in small increments (at least daily, or even several times a day), which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.

# What is Circle CI ?
With CircleCI, you can automate your softwareâ€™s build, test, and deployment and your engineers can get back to work building the features that your users care about the most.

# CircleCI Features:
Following are the most popular features CircleCI offers

* SSH into Builds
* Parallelism
* Resource Class
* Cache
* Workflows
* Monitoring
* Nomad Cluster
* APIs

# CircleCI Project:
A CircleCI project shares the name of the associated code repository in your VCS (GitHub or Bitbucket). Select Add Project from the CircleCI application to enter the Projects dashboard, from where you can set up and follow the projects you have access to.
